## Shared type

a property P will be present if : - it is present in both DecorationTargetProps and InjectedProps - InjectedProps\[P\] can satisfy DecorationTargetProps\[P\] ie: decorated component can accept more types than decorator is injecting

For decoration, inject props or ownProps are all optionally required by the decorated (right hand side) component. But any property required by the decorated component must be satisfied by the injected property.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Shared<InjectedProps, DecorationTargetProps> = {
    [P in Extract<keyof InjectedProps, keyof DecorationTargetProps>]?: InjectedProps[P] extends DecorationTargetProps[P] ? DecorationTargetProps[P] : never;
};
```
