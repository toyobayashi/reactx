## Matching type

A property P will be present if: - it is present in DecorationTargetProps

Its value will be dependent on the following conditions - if property P is present in InjectedProps and its definition extends the definition in DecorationTargetProps, then its definition will be that of DecorationTargetProps\[P\] - if property P is not present in InjectedProps then its definition will be that of DecorationTargetProps\[P\] - if property P is present in InjectedProps but does not extend the DecorationTargetProps\[P\] definition, its definition will be that of InjectedProps\[P\]

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Matching<InjectedProps, DecorationTargetProps> = {
    [P in keyof DecorationTargetProps]: P extends keyof InjectedProps ? InjectedProps[P] extends DecorationTargetProps[P] ? DecorationTargetProps[P] : InjectedProps[P] : DecorationTargetProps[P];
};
```
